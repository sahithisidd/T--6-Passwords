# Task 6 – Creating & Testing Strong Passwords

## Objective
Passwords are the keys to our digital lives — so the stronger, the better.  
For this task, I wanted to see what actually makes a password strong, test a few examples, and figure out the best habits for keeping accounts safe.

## 1. How I Went About It
I came up with four passwords — one embarrassingly weak, one average, one strong, and one super strong.  
Then I ran them through a couple of free password strength tools:  
- [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com)  
- [How Secure Is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net)  

The tools told me their score, how long they’d take to crack, and tips for making them stronger.

## 2. The Test Results

| Password Example | Strength Score | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback from Tools |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| sunshine | *9% – very Weak* | Less than 1 second | Overused, short, no symbols |
| mosoon2025 | *52% – Medium* |1 month | Predictable pattern, no special characters |
| Tr@inB3ll | *90% – Strong* | Centuries | Good complexity and variety |
| F7m$Xb2pLq | *96% – very Strong* | 5 years | Good complexity and variety |
|9v!Qe2PkZxT5rM#L| *100% – Very Strong* | Millions of years | Long, unique, and hard to guess |

## 3. What I Learned
- *Length is king* — even a simple phrase gets way harder to crack if it’s long enough.  
- *Mix it up* — combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes a big difference.  
- *Patterns are dangerous* — something like Name + Year might feel safe, but hackers guess those first.  
- *Passphrases are underrated* — a few random words together can be memorable and strong.

---

## 4. The Threats Out There
- *Brute Force* – Tries every combination until it works (slow but relentless).  
- *Dictionary Attack* – Goes through lists of common words and phrases.  
- *Credential Stuffing* – Reuses passwords from old data breaches.  
- *Phishing* – Tricks you into handing over your password yourself.

## 5. My Takeaways for Better Passwords
1. Go for *at least 12–16 characters*.  
2. Use *all types* of characters — uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
3. Skip personal info like birthdays, pet names, or your favorite sports team.  
4. Try a *random passphrase* — it’s easier to remember than a jumble of symbols.  
5. Store them in a *password manager* so you don’t have to remember them all.  
6. Turn on *multi-factor authentication (MFA)* wherever you can.

## 6. Final Thoughts
This little experiment was eye-opening.  
Some passwords that felt okay were basically open doors to hackers. On the flip side, a long, random passphrase could keep my accounts safe for *millions of years*.
